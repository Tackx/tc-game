# Tic-Tac-Toe

- Written in TypeScript
- Used to practice OOP in TS
  - Still quite new to TS
- Win condition checking algorithm could definitely be improved upon
- Currently only played via CLI

## Gameplay Principles

- At the moment, there is no graphical display of the playing board
  - Instead, after each player plays their coords, the console logs the current array of played coords for each team  
- Both coordinates X and Y start from `1` and can go up to `1000`
- Get 3 coordinates to match up in a linear, horizontal or vertical line to win!
